# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction System

An intelligent web application that uses a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of Chronic Kidney Disease based on key clinical indicators. This project was developed as part of my AI/ML internship.

## Key Features

- **Predictive Model:** Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier trained on a curated medical dataset to achieve high prediction accuracy.
- **Web Interface:** A clean, user-friendly interface built with Flask and Bootstrap allows users to input their medical data and receive instant predictions.
- **End-to-End Pipeline:** The project covers the full machine learning lifecycle, from data cleaning and preprocessing with Pandas to model training with Scikit-learn and deployment.

## Technologies Used

*   **Back-End:** Python, Flask
*   **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Joblib
*   **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
